![Me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/me.png)

A brazilian (he/him) living in Germany for a while already. I'm currently working as Senior Software Engineer at Delivery Hero. As you might know by my posts I like Ruby but also to learn new things and explore the unknown. Starting a masters in "Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence" soon.

Have worked in a bunch of companies and along the way had the opportunity with work with amazing people that helped me come all this way.

I try to share things as I learn so I will try to post more often here, I promise :)
