Hello everyone, don't be afraid with my photo..kkk. my name is Gabriel Malaquias, i'm 23 and systems developer at Locaweb. Currently i'm trying to learn English. My preferred programming language is Ruby <3, but now i'm trying to use some functional language as Elixir or Clojure. I already programmed in Java (the majority at the university), little things in C# and I made some experiences in Android.

The reasons to make this blog are learn english (please be patient with me) and show what i'm doing or learning or studing. Can be useful to somebody or No..kkk

My first Job was Mechanic(when I was 17) and the journey to change my mindset was long and tiring. I have a degree in Analysis and system development, i was graduated a 1 and half year ago, but i still learning everyday with my job collegues.

I believe in team work and engagement, this things are really important to me because i NEVER with know everything and when i really need to do something I give all of me to complete the objectives, I think it is very important to me and company that i work.

That's all I expect that blog can be useful and I will try to have fun writing. Thanks to read!
