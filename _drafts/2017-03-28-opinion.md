Well, I usually saw examples like the following diagram at university:

![dao-java]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/java_dao_example.gif)
http://www.corej2eepatterns.com/DataAccessObject.htm

I remember how is boring to write all DAO implementations because I was just starting, by the time I didn't know any tecnology capable to it by itself. After that I learnt just a little of SpringJPA and also when I was learning it I saw this kind of code:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {
  Long countByLastname(String lastname);
}
```

This example made me think, why do they use Repository to search instead use an ORM like us (Ruby on Rails programmers)?. I think we use ActiveRecord because is natural for us and it can solve our problems however sometimes it causes some problems.
